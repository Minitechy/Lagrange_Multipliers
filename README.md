Code 1 is used to implement the generalized SLSQP Algorithm 1. The algorithm takes into account a budget constraint, requiring that all funds be invested in these _n_ stocks, and ensures that the proportion allocated to each stock is non-negative. Additionally, it considers a portfolio risk constraint. By providing input parameters such as the number of stocks to consider, their respective expected returns, standard deviations, and a predetermined risk tolerance, the algorithm can accurately determine the optimal allocation of funds.

Code 2 is utilized to generate Figure 1 that illustrates the relationship between the portfolio risk and the proportion of Stock _A_. This graph visually represents the impact of varying the allocation of Stock _A_ on the resulting portfolio risk.

Code 3 is employed to generate Figure 2 that visually represents the optimal proportions of Stocks _A_ and _B_ as a function of the portfolio risk tolerance. This graph provides valuable insights into the allocation strategy based on risk tolerance.

Code 4 is employed to generate Figure 3 depicting the maximum expected return of the portfolio  as a function of the correlation coefficient. This graph offers valuable insights into the influence of the correlation coefficient on the portfolioâ€™s performance.

Code 5 is utilized to generate Figure 4 depicting the optimal proportions of Stocks _A_ and _B_ as a function of the correlation coefficient. This graph showcases the dynamic allocation strategies that evolve as the correlation coefficient changes.
